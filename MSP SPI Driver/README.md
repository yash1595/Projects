# SPI DRIVER

Device used:MSP432P401R  
This library is an attempt to write a custom SPI driver for MSP432.  
It has one dependency on the simplelink library containing the cs.h/cs.c files.  
It can be replaced using the known source clock frequency.  
There are some issues in it currently which I am working on.
